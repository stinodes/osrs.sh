# osrs.sh

**A wiki for oldschool runescape**

...Over SSH

## Get started

osrs.sh is written in GO, using the charmbracelet stack, so to speak.  
To run locally, just run `docker compose up`.  
Alternatively, build using GO and execute the binary.

**Note: Demo seems to not be TrueColor. Should not be an issue in actual usage.**
